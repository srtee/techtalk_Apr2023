## About Me

![I did (PhD) weird DNA simulations, (2019-2020) weird protein simulations, and (2021-now) weird electrode-electrolyte simulations. Spot the pattern! Find out more at my (very poorly maintained) [website](https://srtee.github.io).](my_work.png)

Conductive electrode molecular dynamics is implemented in other packages (GROMACS, OpenMM, MetalWalls, ...) but so far only the LAMMPS packages are being widely used outside their developing group!

## Method Development Cycle in Molecular Dynamics

* Implementation
* Benchmarking
* Documentation
* Distribution

LAMMPS is a great _community code_ for this cycle!

::: {.notes}
* Implementation: theory, algorithms, code
* Benchmarking: measuring performance or accuracy gains
* Documentation: setting up user interfaces
* Distribution: getting code onto people's machines and HPCs
:::

## A Brief LAMMPS History [@thompson2022]

* Mid-1990s: 
  * Collab (two US DoE labs and three companies)
  * free Fortran code with license agreement
  * 10 years ... 100 downloads

* 2004:
  * C++ GPL code, 50k lines of code
  * downloaded more times in first month than in previous ten years

* Today:
  * 1 million lines of code, several hundred contributors
  * 20-30k downloads per year

# Lessons: ASAP and AMAP

## Lessons Learned from LAMMPS [@plimpton2019lessons]

> **ASAP**: Make your code _as simple as possible_ to understand and extend
>
> **AMAP**: Enable it to be used in _as many as possible_ ways
>
> **Licensing**: LGPL can be a good compromise

See also: [@lammpscommcode]

::: {.notes}
* GPL: derivative works must also be open sourced
* _LGPL: use-by-linking is not considered derivative_
* BSD: "do whatever" (good for companies, bad for OSS devs)
:::

## ASAP and AMAP in LAMMPS

* Drop a `.cpp` and `.h` into `lammps/src` and compile, and you get an add-on!
* LAMMPS can be called as a library:
  * Interfaces: C-style, Python, SWIG
  * Internally-implemented `fix external`
  * Caller can start multiple LAMMPS instances and coordinate messages between them

## AMAP: LAMMPS Inputs As Workflows

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width=40% .smaller}

Other packages: "turn these dials"

LAMMPS: "put these dials on your system and turn them"

(For example, a script won't run any steps without `run` and won't move any atoms without an integrator like `fix nvt`!)

Resembles "fluent interface" philosophy

::::

:::: {.column width=60% .smaller}

{{< include in.peptide >}}

::::

:::

## ASAP 1: Simple, Clear Coding

LAMMPS uses "C with classes":

* Very little overloading, templating, STL (slowly increasing)
* Low-level structs and kernels are C-style (e.g. n-dim arrays)
* Detailed comments wherever needed

## ASAP 2-4: Straightforward extensibility

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width=50% .smaller .tightlist}

What do you think this code does?

::::

:::: {.column width=50% .smaller}
{{< include _fix_jumble.qmd >}}
::::

:::

## ASAP 2: Robust core, clear "sockets"

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width=50% .smaller .tightlist}
**Timestep loop:**

* timestep initialization
* `fix->initial()`
* (sometimes) rebuild neighbor list 
* or send ghost atoms
* force initialization
* `fix->pre_force()`
* compute forces
* `fix->pre_reverse()`
* receive ghost forces
* `fix->post_force()`
* finalize and output

::::

:::: {.column width=50% .smaller}
{{< include _fix_jumble.qmd >}}
::::

:::

## ASAP 3: Good parenting, easy children

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width=50% .smaller .tightlist}

Parent "styles" define interfaces:

* `pair` for MD potentials
* `compute` for diagnostics (temperature, pressure)
* `fix` for doing _anything_

Children styles inherit interface from parents; just `override` specific parent virtual functions as needed

::::

:::: {.column width=50% .smaller .tightlist}
{{< include _fix_jumble.qmd >}}
::::

:::

## ASAP 3: Parenting Pointers

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width=50% .smaller .tightlist}

`Pointers` class makes shared data "quasi-static":

```{.cpp filename="pointers.h"}
class Pointers {
 protected:
  LAMMPS *lmp;     // ...
  Atom *&atom;     // ...

 public:
  Pointers(LAMMPS *ptr) :
   lmp(ptr),       // ...
   atom(ptr->atom),// ...
}
```

Now anything inheriting `Pointers` auto-gets references to the necessary data contained in `lmp`!

::::

:::: {.column width=50% .smaller .tightlist}
{{< include _fix_jumble.qmd >}}
::::

:::

## ASAP 4: Style Factories

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width=50% .smaller .tightlist}

Factory pattern creates a derived `FixJumble` and returns a `Fix` pointer to LAMMPS:

```{.cpp filename="modify.cpp"}
// ...
#define FIX_CLASS

#define FixStyle(_key, _Class)
   (*fix_map)[#_key] 
     = &style_creator<Fix, _Class>;

// C/Make'd list of fixes
#include "style_fix.h" // IWYU pragma: keep
#undef FixStyle
#undef FIX_CLASS
// ...
```

```{.cpp filename="fix_jumble.h"}
// ...
#ifdef FIX_CLASS
FixStyle(jumble,FixJumble);
#else
// ...
```

::::

:::: {.column width=50% .smaller .tightlist}
{{< include _fix_jumble.qmd >}}
::::

:::

## AMAP: Making LAMMPS a Library

* `LAMMPS_NS` namespace prevents code collisions
* Global (static) variables replaced with `Pointer` class
* `MPI_COMM_WORLD` replaced with communicator used to initialize LAMMPS

```{.cpp filename="main.cpp"}
LAMMPS *lammps = new LAMMPS(argc, argv, lammps_comm);
lammps->input->file();
delete lammps;
```



# Challenges and the Future

## Successes ...

User almost completely modified code on their own, made a suitable test, and was just missing some technical details on atom indexing in LAMMPS:

![](scr_success.png)

## ... and Failures

User had an idea for a complicated compute to be used in evaluating a potential, and was asking basic and strange questions _a year after his original post_:

![](scr_failure.png)

## Deep Thought: Programming as Theory-Building

::: {.smaller}

> Programming isn't about writing the code; it's about **understanding the problem and expressing that understanding through code**.  (emphasis added)
>
> ... Why does having a theory of the program matter? Because this enables rapid and effective modification of the program to respond to changing requirements without piling up technical debt or hacks.
